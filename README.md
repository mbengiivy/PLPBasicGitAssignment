# PLPBasicGitAssignment
A Github repository for the Power Learn Project
I am a student of the Power Learn Project that is based on creating 1 million devs 4 Africa
To add these documents to the repo, I initialised a git repo on my local device
I then added a file called Hello.txt to the folder manually
I then added it to the local repositiry using git add
The repo was already connected to the remote repo on github 
I pushed the changes to the repo and committed them with a message.
